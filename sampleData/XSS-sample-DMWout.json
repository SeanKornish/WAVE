Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other web site. When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user\u2019s browser. The browser then executes the code because it came from a \"trusted\" server. Reflected XSS is also sometimes referred to as Non-Persistent or Type-II XSS.","attack_hints":["What happens when you enter special characters (e.g. \"<\")?","How are HTML tags treated (e.g. \"<b>\")","Have you tried \"<script>\""],"technology":"JSP"},"remediation_code":[{"file":"reflected-xss.html.zip","technology":"HTML","client-server":"client"},{"file":"hello-rem.jsp.zip","technology":"JSP","client-server":"client"}]}
